# crewmanager
Portal to manage shipping crew (availability, certification etc)

This portal should enable HQ with the tools to manage their shipping crew. This includes an overview of holidays and certification expiry. It should also hold all the crew information like passport, address etc. so security is very important. The portal will enable HQ to quickly view if a ship has enough crew members or contact available replacement crew if someone is sick.

Framework to be used: Laravel 

A more detailed readme will follow after the first submit.
